# MITRO Project

*Goal* "Implement the 2-approximation algorithm (see image below) for the densest subgraph problem. The running time of your algorithm should be linear (in
the size of the input graph) in the worst-case."

This directory contains : <br>
- the 5 pages report
- the complete code, with some annotations (in french).
- some relatively small graph in the format required to compute the algorithm yourself
